In this repository you can find databases I've made as well as procedures for the AdventureWorks2014 library.

Shown below is some work I did on a database I made for a fictional library system.
This particular procedure was created in case someone wanted to find all the Stephen King books at the "Central" branch.


![Procedure1](https://github.com/LewisCWarren/SQL-projects/blob/master/Screenshot%20(30).png)

This query is designed to find out how many books a person has on loan, if that person has more than 5 books out.



![Procedure2](https://github.com/LewisCWarren/SQL-projects/blob/master/Screenshot%20(31).png)

And this one can tell you how many books are out from each library in the system.

This last photo just shows me creating a table and some records to test out procedures on.
